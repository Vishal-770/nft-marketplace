# 🔒 Security Policy

## Overview

The NFT Marketplace project takes security seriously. This document outlines our security practices, vulnerability reporting process, and guidelines for maintaining a secure platform.

## 🛡️ Security Features

### Smart Contract Security

Our smart contracts implement multiple security layers:

#### **OpenZeppelin Integration**
- Battle-tested contract implementations
- Regular security updates and patches
- Industry-standard security patterns

#### **Built-in Security Measures**
- **Reentrancy Protection**: Guards against reentrancy attacks
- **Access Control**: Owner-only administrative functions with role-based permissions
- **Transfer Locks**: Prevents NFT transfers during active rental periods
- **Overflow Protection**: Solidity 0.8+ built-in overflow/underflow protection
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all user inputs

#### **Network Security**
- **zkSync Sepolia Testnet**: Deployed on secure Layer 2 infrastructure
- **Thirdweb Integration**: Leveraging enterprise-grade deployment tools
- **Contract Verification**: All contracts are verified and publicly auditable

### Frontend Security

#### **Environment Protection**
- **Secure API Key Management**: Environment variables for sensitive data
- **Client-Side Validation**: Input sanitization and validation
- **Server-Side Validation**: Double validation on backend operations

#### **File Upload Security**
- **File Type Validation**: Restricted to image formats only
- **Size Limits**: 10MB maximum file size for uploads
- **IPFS Integration**: Decentralized storage via Pinata with content addressing

#### **Web3 Security**
- **Wallet Integration**: Secure connection with MetaMask and compatible wallets
- **Transaction Validation**: Pre-flight checks for all blockchain transactions
- **Gas Estimation**: Accurate gas estimation to prevent failed transactions

## 🚨 Supported Versions

We actively maintain and provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| Latest  | ✅ Fully supported |
| 0.1.x   | ✅ Security fixes  |

## 📢 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### **Critical Security Issues**

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

#### **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities

#### **DO** report via one of these secure channels:

1. **Email**: Send details to `security@nft-marketplace.dev` (if available)
2. **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use the "Report a vulnerability" feature
3. **Direct Contact**: Reach out to the maintainer [@Vishal-770](https://github.com/Vishal-770)

### **What to Include in Your Report**

Please provide the following information:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential security impact and severity
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Proof of Concept**: Code snippet or demonstration (if applicable)
- **Suggested Fix**: Potential solutions or mitigations
- **Environment**: Version, network, and configuration details

### **Response Timeline**

We are committed to responding promptly to security reports:

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 24 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Status Update**: Weekly updates until resolution
- **Fix Deployment**: Based on severity (24 hours - 2 weeks)

## 🔒 Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

#### **Smart Contract Development**
```solidity
// ✅ Good: Use OpenZeppelin contracts
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol";

contract SecureContract is ReentrancyGuard {
    function secureFunction() external nonReentrant {
        // Implementation here
    }
}

// ❌ Avoid: Custom security implementations without thorough testing
```

#### **Frontend Development**
```typescript
// ✅ Good: Validate inputs
function validateNFTData(data: NFTData): boolean {
  return data.name.length > 0 && 
         data.description.length <= 1000 &&
         isValidImageFormat(data.imageFile);
}

// ❌ Avoid: Direct user input usage
```

### For Users

#### **Wallet Security**
- **Use Hardware Wallets**: For significant value transactions
- **Verify Transactions**: Always review transaction details before signing
- **Check Contract Addresses**: Verify contract addresses before interacting
- **Keep Software Updated**: Use latest wallet and browser versions

#### **Safe Trading Practices**
- **Verify NFT Authenticity**: Check creator and metadata
- **Research Before Buying**: Understand the project and team
- **Start Small**: Test with small amounts first
- **Be Wary of Scams**: Avoid too-good-to-be-true offers

## 🔍 Security Audits

### Current Status

- **Code Review**: All smart contracts undergo peer review
- **Automated Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with edge cases
- **Static Analysis**: ESLint and Solidity analyzers
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular dependency vulnerability checks

### Future Plans

- **Professional Audit**: Planning third-party security audit
- **Bug Bounty Program**: Considering bug bounty program launch
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Implementing real-time security monitoring

## 🛠️ Security Tools and Dependencies

### Smart Contract Tools
- **OpenZeppelin Contracts**: ^5.0.0 (security-focused implementations)
- **Hardhat**: Development environment with security plugins
- **Slither**: Static analysis for Solidity (planned)

### Frontend Tools
